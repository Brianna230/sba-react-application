# SBA REACT APPLICATION

My SBA is a beer theme website. Users can browese different type of beer and add them to the carts and remove them.

## Technologies Used

I use different type of hooks like useState to set data and I use useEffect to fetch data from the beer api. I also use useContext to manage data like add and removing items from the cart.
